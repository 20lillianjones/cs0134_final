         <p>Hello! My name is Lillian Jones. I am originally from Latrobe, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour outside of Pittsburgh. This means I've been a big
            Yinzer my entire life. I am currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Computer Engineering.<br><br>However, enough about my
            professional life. One of my favorite hobbies as always been trying new food. I was never a picky eater, even as a child. Although I am not a fan of everything,
            I have never shied away from at least trying a bite.
         </p>

            When I knew I would be attending the University of Pittsburgh, and thus, would be living in Pittsburgh full-time, there was one thing that I was
            particularly excited for: trying new foods! And over the past four-and-a-half years, my girlfriend, Maddie, and I have done exactly that. We have
            tried almost every cuisine, from Japanese, Indian, Vietnamese, African- you name it.
         </p>
